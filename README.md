Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step

- In this task, you will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
- In the next task, you will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

**After this task you will be able to:**
- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

**Notation**:
- Superscript $[l]$ denotes a quantity associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. 
    - Example: $a^{[L]}$ is the $L^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[L]}$ and $b^{[L]}$ are the $L^{th}$ layer parameters.
- Superscript $(i)$ denotes a quantity associated with the $i^{th}$ example. 
    - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example.
- Lowerscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.
    - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the $l^{th}$ layer's activations).
